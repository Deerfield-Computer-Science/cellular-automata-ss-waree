How would you change the color of the grass? 
Just override it in the constructor of grass. myColor = Color.xxx

Describe how grass reproduces. 
Randomly placed at new location (the starter code). But I would like grass to spread to adjacent locations.

How could you make sure the grass does not reproduce a new grass plant on top of an existing grass? 
Set an if condition to redo the reproduction if that happens. (I have a isOccupied method to determine if there is something else in that location.)

How are the creatures stored and manipulated? 
In the arraylist of LifeForms named creatureList

What is the point of the method purgeTheDead()? 
To remove dead things from the arraylist so they don’t interfere.

Do the creatures have a location, or do locations have a creature? 
Creatures have a location.

Does the world have creatures or do the creatures have a world?  Why is this necessary? 
Creatures have a world. (Still thinking about the latter part)

How would you make a creature move?  Describe what methods you would add and where you would put them? 
Abstract method in each animal's class because each creature moves differently.
